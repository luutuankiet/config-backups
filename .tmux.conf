# BUNCH OF CLIPBOARD HELPERS

set-option -s set-clipboard off
# This setting disables clipboard support in Tmux. By default, Tmux doesn't pass text copied to the system clipboard into its own buffer, and vice versa. This setting turns off clipboard support, so Tmux won't interfere with the system clipboard.

bind P paste-buffer #  This setting binds the `prefix-P` key combination to paste the contents of the Tmux buffer into the current pane. This is a useful shortcut for pasting text that you've previously copied within Tmux.

unbind -T copy-mode-vi Enter # This setting unbinds the `Enter` key in Tmux's "copy mode"

bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'xclip -se c -i' # This setting binds the `Enter` key in Tmux's "copy mode" to copy the selected text to the system clipboard using `xclip`. This command works with the `-se c` option to use the default clipboard and the `-i` option to read input from STDIN.
